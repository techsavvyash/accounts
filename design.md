I am building a platform for managing my business accounts. I have the following use cases:
1. We should have the ability of inventory management
2. We should have the ability of invoice management
3. We should have the ability of account management
4. We should have the ability of credit notes
5. We should have the ability of debit notes
6. We should have GST based taxation
7. We should have GST return generation - atleast R1 and 3B
8. We should have the ability to print PDFs of the bills


Role based access control with [admin, owner and sales person] roles with different and limited access around what all they can do.

We should also have support for analytics on the sales data, prices etc.

We should build it in an API first and hackable manner so that it can be used by multiple different clients like a webapp, a mobile app, a whatsapp bot etc.
